A # AzureMock
A older project for a in memory mock of Azure Table Service.

This project has not been updated to match the latest SDK for Azure, but it shows some interesting coding in terms of 
simple parsing via regular expressions and the use of dynamically created lambdas to implement the tables queries against the
mock in memory collection.
